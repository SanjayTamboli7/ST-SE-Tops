OOP : Object Oriented Programming 

=> Security 

1. Class and Objects

=> Class (Logical Entity)
=> HUMAN
=> animal
=> blueprint
=> car




=> Object:(Physical entity)
=> Real world entity  
=> break,male,female,remote,cow,cat
=> instance of a class

class className 
{
    ...var 
    ...functions
}

var/let/const varname = new className
varname(obj).properties (var/fun)

obj ==> class 

you can access anything inside class through object





2. Encapsulation : hiding details from oputside world
3. Abstraction : only access those details which are necessary

4. Inheritance : Reuse code

==> using this we can access properties of one class to another class 

parent==> property 
child ==> inherit 

==> we must create object of child class

class Parent 
{
    properties...
}


class Child extends Parent
{
    properties...
}




5. Polymorphism
